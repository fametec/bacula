Note: This file is not the Bacula Community (bacula.org) license,
which you will find in the LICENSE file. This is a FAQ about the
Bacula AGPLv3 and the other third-party licenses used in certain
source code files of the Bacula software.


             Affero General Public License
History:
The original Bacula code was Copyright Kern Sibbald and John Walker.
After November 2004, it became Copyright Kern Sibbald, and finally,
the copyright was transferred to the Free Software Foundation Europe
on 15 November 2006. The license was changed from GPLv2 to AGPLv3
on 24 July 2010. The copyright Fiduciary License Agreement signed 
with Kern Sibbald and the FSFE 15 November 2006 was terminated as
of 3 March 2015.  Code subsequent to 3 March 2015 is 
Copyright, Kern Sibbald.

Trademark:
The name Bacula is a registered trademark of Kern Sibbald.

"Fair use" of the trademark is permitted following standard customs
that any prominent use (e.g.  cover of a book) or the first use of
the name Bacula will include a trademark symbol.  If you fork the
Bacula project and make any significant changes to the functionality
of Bacula, to avoid confusion between your fork and Bacula, you must
give your fork another name.  You are not required to remove all
references to Bacula in the source code or "fair uses" in the
documentation.

===================================

What follows is information from the authors of the code:

License:
To the best of our knowledge, all code used in Bacula, which is
copyrighted by a third party, has licenses that are compatible
with the OpenSSL license, and so given the exceptions that we have
made to the AGPLv3 (in LICENSE), Bacula can be freely linked and distributed
with the OpenSSL libraries, and in binary form with the Microsoft
VSS libraries.

Intellectual Property rights:
Recipient understands that although each Contributor to Bacula grants
the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights or otherwise.  As a condition to exercising the rights
and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
needed, if any.  For example, if a third party patent license is
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing
the Program.

Copyrights:
Each Contributor to Bacula represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

Bacula can be enabled with data encryption and/or communications
encryption. If this is the case, you will be including OpenSSL code that
contains cryptographic software written by Eric Young
(eay@cryptsoft.com) and also software written by Tim Hudson
(tjh@cryptsoft.com).

There are parts of Bacula that are licensed under the BSD 2-Clause so
that those files may be used in proprietary code to interface with
Bacula.

Finally there are parts of Bacula that are in the public domain.
