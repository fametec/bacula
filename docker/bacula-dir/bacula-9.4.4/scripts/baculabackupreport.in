# ----------------------------
#
#
# 20130428 - Initial release
#            Generate and email a basic Bacula backup report
#            1st command line parameter is expected to be a
#            number of hours. No real error checking is done
#
# 20131224 - Removed "AND JobStatus='T'" to get all backup jobs
#            whether running, or completed with errors etc.
#          - Added Several fields "StartTime", "EndTime",
#            "JobFiles"
#          - Removed "JobType" because we are only selecting
#            jobs of type "Backup" (AND Type='B')
#          - Modified header lines and printf lines for better
#            formatting
#
# 20140107 - Modified script to include more information and cleaned
#            up the output formatting
#
# 20150704 - Added ability to work with MySQL or Postgresql
#
# 20150723 - Modified query, removed "Type='B'" clause to catch all jobs,
#            including Copy jobs, Admin jobs etc. Modified header, and
#            output string to match new query and include job's "Type"
#            column.
#
# 20170225 - Rewrote awk script so that a status/summary could be set in
#            the email report's subject. eg:
#            Subject: "serverName - All Jobs OK in the past x hours"
#            Subject: "serverName - x Jobs FAILED in the past y hours"
#
# 20170303 - Fixed output in cases where there are jobs running and there
#            is no "Stop Time" for a job.
#
# 20170406 - Some major modifications:
#             - Added feature to spell out words instead of using the
#               single character codes for Job type, Job Status, and
#               Job Level - Including the different levels for Verify
#               jobs
#             - If a job terminates with an error or warning, then the
#               job's line in the output is prepended with an asterisk
#               "*" for quick visual identification
#             - Modified the outputs of the files and bytes fields to
#               include commas when the number is > 999
#             - Added totals to the end of the report for Jobs, Files,
#               and Bytes
#             - Added $sortfield and $sortorder variables to allow output
#               to be sorted as desired
#             - Set the level of a job to "----" when the level is not
#               applicable as in Restore jobs, Admin jobs etc.
#
# 20170408 - Some minor cleanup, and moving things around
#          - Added $emailsummaries variable to append the job summaries
#            to the end of the report.
#          - Added $emailbadlogs variable to append full joblogs of jobs
#            which have failed or jobs with errors to the end of the report
#            for quick access to investigate failed jobs.
#
# 20170417 - Added some tests for binaries and the bconsole config file
#
# 20170429 - Thanks to Chris Couture for contacting me and submitting a
#            working query for MariaDB. I have added 'mariadb' as a new
#            dbtype option.
#          - Thanks to Chris Couture for the ideas and some code examples
#            to create an HTML email.
#              - Added $html variable to enable HTML emails.
#              - Added $boldstatus variable to make the Status <b>bold</b>
#                in HTML emails.
#              - Added $colorstatusbg variable to color the background of
#                the Status cell in HTML emails.
#          - Thanks to Chris Couture for the idea of adding RunTime
#            to the email output.
#          - Thanks to Chris Couture for the idea of using some unicode
#            characters (a 'checkmark'or a bold 'x') in the Subject:
#            to quickly see if everything ran OK.
#              - Added $addsubjecticon variable to enable/disable the
#                prepending of this icon to the Subject.
#          - Added $printsumary variable to give the option to print the
#            total Jobs, Files, and Bytes after the job listing table.
#          - Added $starbadjobids variable to enable/disable prepending
#            the bad jobids with an asterisk "*".
#          - Modified the way the email is built at the end. Thanks to
#            Chris Courture again for this nice idea.
#          - Added $jobtableheadercolor, $jobtablejobcolor, $goodjobcolor,
#            $goodjobwitherrcolor, $runningjobcolor, $warnjobcolor, and
#            $badjobcolor variables to colorize HTML emails
#          - Added $emailtitle variable for the title at the top
#          - Added $fontfamily, $fontsize, $fontsizejobinfo, and $fontsizesumlog
#            variables to allow styling of the HTML output (Thanks again Chris)
#          - Added $nojobsicon, $goodjobsicon, and $badjobsicon variables to
#            allow setting the prepended utf-8 subject icon character
#          - Reformatted things so that if there are no jobs returned by the
#            SQL query, the email message sent is nice and short
#          - Modified the license to allow for inclusion into Bacula Community,
#            and possibly the Enterprise Edition releases
#
# 20170430 - Modified the order of the fields to make more sense
#          - Re-aligned the text email so that when an asterisk is pre-pended it
#            does not shift the whole line
#
# 20170508 - Re-worked some of the logic so that good jobs (JobStatus="T") which
#            have errors will have their status listed as "OK/Warnings", and it
#            will not trigger as a "bad job" on the JobErrors, so it will not
#            have an asterisk prepended to the JobId in the job listing. I think
#            this fix is more of a temporary change in the hopes that a "W"
#            status to represent "good jobs with warnings" is implemented in the
#            db in the future.
#          - Added an "Errors" column to the table to show "JobErrors" from the
#            db.
#          - Some minor variable name changes and other minor changes
#
# 20170511 - Minor adjustments to the alignment formatting of the text email
#          - Minor 'case' changes to a couple levels (Init & VCat)

# I like small tabs. Use  :set list in vim to see tabbing etc
