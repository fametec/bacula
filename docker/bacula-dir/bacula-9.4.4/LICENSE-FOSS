                Update 21 May 2017

Note: This file corresponds to the Bacula Community (bacula.org) license.

Trademark:
The name Bacula is a registered trademark of Kern Sibbald.

"Fair use" of the trademark is permitted following standard customs
that any prominent use (e.g.  cover of a book) or the first use of
the name Bacula will include a trademark symbol.  If you fork the
Bacula project and make any significant changes to the functionality
of Bacula, to avoid confusion between your fork and Bacula, you must
give your fork another name.  You are not required to remove all
references to Bacula in the source code or "fair uses" in the
documentation.

Forking Bacula:
Bacula is Free Software/Open Source Software and as such you are
permitted to fork it and/or use parts of it. However, if you fork
Bacula or you use more than one or two lines of code from it, you
must respect the copyright which requires you to maintain the headers
containing the Copyright information intact on any files which you
use. If you take more than a couple of lines of code, you are required
to add the Bacula Copyright to your code (see the file: LICENSE or any
header of a file for what is necessary).

If you have previously forked Bacula, please be aware that the license
on the current code has most likely changed since your fork, and you
must respect the new license.

If you are thinking that this requirement to maintain the license intact is
unusual or not open source, I would like to point out that most open source
licenses require this.  One simple example is the BSD 2-clause license,
which is widely used, and which Bacula uses for most of the script files.

===================================

What follows is information from the authors of the code:

License:
To the best of our knowledge, all code used in Bacula, which is
copyrighted by a third party, has licenses that are compatible.

Intellectual Property rights:
Recipient understands that although each Contributor to Bacula grants
the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights or otherwise.  As a condition to exercising the rights
and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
needed, if any.  For example, if a third party patent license is
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing
the Program.

Copyrights:
Each Contributor to Bacula represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
the copyright license set forth in the LICENSE file..

Notices:
The Bacula community version uses a certain number of files that have
FOSS (Free or Open Software) licenses.  Many of these files come from and are
identical to the Bacula community code.  Most 3rd party FOSS licenses require
no notification so they are not included here. 

However, the Bacula Community binary releases consist of 
files, with few source files (mostly scripts), and some of the FOSS licenses
such as the BSD (Berkeley Software Development) require publication of
the copyright notices if the code is released in binary format.  For example
certain copyright notifications are simplifed such as:

# Copyright (C) 2000-2017 Kern Sibbald
# License: BSD 2-Clause; see file LICENSE-FOSS

This license corresponds to the following:
